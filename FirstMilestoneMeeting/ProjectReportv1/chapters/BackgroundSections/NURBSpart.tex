%As mentioned in the Introduction, the main challenge of our project is to convert the mesh based geometry, obtained on a previous step, back to CAD representation. 
Parametrised geometries are often given in terms of \emph{Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline} (NURBS) curve patches (see for example, documentation of FreeCAD software \cite{FreeCAD}). 
To define NURBS from a mathematical standpoint, we first define so-called \emph{Bezier curves} and use them later for the definition of NURBS. For these two sections, we refer to \cite{farin2002handbook} for a more in-depth introduction and further material. 
\subsection{Bezier Curves}
A Bezier curve is a \textit{parametric} curve, which is often used for producing a smooth approximation of a given set of data points.
 
An analytical expression for the Bezier curve parametrized by the variable $u$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
\vec{B}(u)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^n b_i^n(u) \vec{P}_i
\end{equation*}
where $\vec{P}_i$ is the $i^{\text{th}}$ control point, $i\in0,1, \dots ,n$ ($n+1$ control points in total), and
\begin{equation*}
b_i^n(u)=\binom{n}{i}(1-u)^{(n-i)}u^i
\end{equation*}
with $\binom{n}{i}$ being a binomial coefficient, is the $i^{\text{th}}$ \emph{Bernstein polynomial} (see \cite{lorentz2012bernstein}) of degree $n$.

Additionally to the expression with the Bernstein polynomials, one can use a recursion formula (so-called \emph{de Casteljau Algorithm}) for the construction of the Bezier curve, which we will not cover here.

Analogically to Bezier curves, but with $n\cdot m$ points $\vec{P}_{i,j}$,
one can define a \textit{Bezier surface}, given by the analytical expression
\begin{equation*}
\vec{S}(u,v)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^n \sum\limits_{j=0}^m b_i^n(u) b_j^m(v) \vec{P}_{i,j}
\end{equation*}
\\
Note that Bezier curves and surfaces may be unstable -- minor changes in control points might lead to major global changes.


\subsection{NURBS basis functions}
Extending the idea described in previous section, one could use \emph{B-spline basis functions} (see below) instead of the Bernstein polynomial basis.

Unlike with Bezier curves, for the B-splines a parameter domain is subdivided by so-called \textit{knots}. For the one-dimensional parameter domain $[u_{0}, u_{m}]$, the \textit{knot vector} will be given by $u_{0} \leq u_{1} \leq ... \leq u_{m}$. In most cases $u_{0} = 0, u_{m} = 1$ is chosen, so that we get the unit interval for our parameter values. For the case of NURBS, the knots $u_{0},..., u_{m}$ need not be equidistant -- hence the Non-Uniform in the beginning NU of NURBS.

Given a knot vector $[u_{0}, u_{m}]$ and a degree of B-spline $p$, the $i$-th B-spline basis function is then defined recursively as follows:
\begin{equation}
N_{i,0}(u) =  \begin{cases} 1, & \mbox{if } u_{i} \leq u < u_{i+1} \\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise } \end{cases}
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
N_{i,p}(u) = \frac{u - u_{i}}{u_{i+p} - u_{i}}N_{i, p-1}(u)  + \frac{u_{i+p+1}-u}{u_{i+p+1} - u_{i+1}}N_{i+1, p-1}(u)
\end{equation}
For $p=0$ we get just step functions, and $p=1$ familiar hat functions, whereas the quadratic basis functions look more complicated (\autoref{fig:bsplineBases}).
\begin{figure}

\begin{subfigure}[B-spline basis for $p=0$]{

\end{subfigure}%
\begin{subfigure}[B-spline basis for $p=1$]{

\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[B-spline basis for $p=2$]{

\end{subfigure}
\caption{B-spline basis functions, of degree $p=0$ (left), $p=1$ (middle) and $p=2$ (right).}
\label{fig:bsplineBases}
\end{figure}


By giving each of these basis functions a weight $\omega_i$ and normalizing them at each point by dividing by the total sum, we get the rational basis functions. Writing them out explicitly, in terms of B-spline basis functions $N_{i,p}$, the $n^{\text{th}}$-degree NURBS curve with $k$ control points $P_i$ is finally given by:
\begin{equation}
C(u) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k}N_{i,n}\omega_{i}P_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}N_{i,n}\omega_{i}}.
\end{equation}

B-splines are have the following properties, which are useful for our problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item Degree $n$ and number of control points $\vec{P}_{i\cdots m}$ are independent.
\item B-Splines only change locally (depending on the degree $n$) when a control point is changed.
\end{itemize}

Analogically to the Bezier curve surfaces, one can define B-spline or NURBS surfaces. For more information about NURBS see \cite{farin1999nurbs}.
\subsection{Fitting problem}
In order to represent a given line or surface by Bezier curves or surfaces respectively, just as with NURBS, one has to solve a fitting problem. The goal of it is to fit in a parametric curve to the set of given data points. In the case of interest, the given set of points is a mesh, obtained from surface contouring.
\subsubsection{Fitting problem: Bezier curve}
First we want to find a Bezier-curve $\vec{B}_n\left(u\right)$ of degree $n$ which is approximating a given spline $\vec{s}_m\left(u\right)$ defined by $m$ points in a optimal way. For this purpose we want to minimize the L2-error. This leads to the minimization problem
\begin{equation}
\text{find\ } \underset{\vec{B}_n\in \mathbb{B}_n}{\min} \Ltwonorm{\vec{B}_n-\vec{s}_m}.
\end{equation}
Minimizing the L2-norm is equal to minimizing the functional:
\begin{equation}
F(\vec{B}_n)=\int\limits_{u=0}^{u=1} \left(\vec{B}_n-\vec{s}_m\right)^2\du
\end{equation}
Using the variational principle we get the the system of linear equations
\begin{equation}
A a = b
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the matrix of pair-wise scalar products of basis functions (Bernstein polynomials), $b$ is the vector of scalar products of the given spline $s_{m}$ and basis functions and $a$ is a required vector of coefficients for Bezier curve representation.

\subsubsection{Fitting problem (least squares): NURBS}
Although the approach used above showed good results, it appears to be very computationally intensive. Analogically, one could reduce the original problem to a \emph{regression problem}, which allows us to reduce computational costs. Also, to improve the locality of our solution, from now on we are going to use NURBS basis functions with weights $\omega_{j} = 1$ instead of Bezier curves. For this purpose, we adopted an algorithm, provided in \cite{becker2011advanced}:

Let $X^{0}$ be the $n \times 2$ matrix of the given set of points, $N^{p}$ the basis functions of degree $p$ ($n \times (n+p)$ matrix, where $n$ is the number of points), and $P^{0}$ the control points ($(n+p) \times 2$ matrix).

The original problem can be written as:
\begin{equation}
X_{i}^{0} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n+p} P_{j}^{0} N_{i,j}^{p}, \quad i \in \{1,..,n\}
\end{equation}
Or, in short:
\begin{equation}
X^{0} = N^{p} P^{0}
\end{equation}
The above system needs to be solved for the unknown $P^{0}$. This can be done numerically, for example through singular value decomposition.

\subsection{Fitting pipeline}
\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=.85\linewidth]{Fitting_workflow.png}
  \caption{NURBS fitting pipeline}
  \label{fig:fitting_pipeline}
\end{figure}
Since the geometry obtained after topology optimization can be arbitrary complex, we might not be able to find a good fit using only one patch. We seek a multi step algorithm, allowing us to break the overall big problem into smaller problems, which can be handled relatively easy.
Based on the algorithm described in \cite{eck1996automatic}, our overall fitting pipeline looks as follows (see \autoref{fig:fitting_pipeline}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Patch selection (breaking our problem in small pieces which can be solved using least squares)
	\item Parametrization of obtained patches
	\item B-spline fitting using least squares
	\item Smooth connection of patches
	\item Conversion back to CAD
\end{itemize}

The pipeline given above, once implemented, will provide us with a flexible algorithm for converting an arbitrary complex mesh based geometry into NURBS and, hence, CAD-representation.
