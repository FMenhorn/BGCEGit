\subsection{Aims and Goals}
The aim of the project is to provide a tool, which allows to perform \textit{Topology Optimisation} without leaving CAD--framework. This includes the reaching of the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation of \textit{Topology Optimisation} using available open source libraries
\item Development of the flexible tool for the conversion of the optimized surface to back to the CAD format.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Timeline and Structure}
The project is to be completed within 10 months. This period is divided into 4 phases:\\

\textbf{Phase 1:} Getting familiar with the topic and agreement on the project specification.\\

\textbf{Phase 2:} Implementation of the first part of the pipeline (Topology Optimisation from CAD surface using existing tools), investigating the tools and algorithms available for the conversion of the geometry generated after topology optimisation back to CAD format (later referred as \textit{NURBS fitting pipeline}), prototyping (using MATLAB) and evaluating of found solutions.\\

\textbf{Phase 3:} Reimplementing the prototypes, developed on a previous stage, using an open source language, such as Python or C++, extension of the NURBS fitting algorithm to more complex cases, finalising the first part of the pipeline.\\

\textbf{Phase 4:} Implementation of the extended NURBS fitting algorithm, integrating it with the \textit{Topology Optimisation} part and forming of final deliverables.
