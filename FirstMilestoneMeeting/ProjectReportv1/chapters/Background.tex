\section{CAD in computers}
%interaction with it, programs, geometry represenations, datastructures, formats etc., maybe even history if we're overkill


\section{Topology Optimisation}
%how the algorithms work, maybe what it can be used for

\section{From CAD to Voxels}

\section{From Voxels to a surface representation}
%marching cubes and so on

\section{From a surface representation to NURBS}

\subsection{what are nurbs}%move this if it makes more sense elsewhere
