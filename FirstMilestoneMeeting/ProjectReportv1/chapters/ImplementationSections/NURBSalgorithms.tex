The current state of the art provides no open source software, providing the conversion from a \textit{mesh-based} geometry to NURBS representation. Hence, one of the main challenges of both, algorithmic and implementation parts of this project, is to develop one from scratch. Due to variety of possible approaches to tackle this problem (ex. \cite{becker2011advanced},\cite{eck1996automatic} ), a profound prototyping work was conducted. In order to avoid a cumbersome and time-consuming implementation during the prototyping phase, MATLAB language was used. Once algorithms to be used are finalized, prototypes are to be implemented using a non-proprietary languages, such as Python or C++.
