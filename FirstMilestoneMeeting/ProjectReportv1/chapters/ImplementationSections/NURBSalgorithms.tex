The current state of the art provides no open source software, providing the conversion from a \textit{mesh-based} geometry to NURBS representation. Hence, one of the main challenges of both the algorithmic and implementation part of this project is to develop one from scratch. Due to a variety of possible approaches to tackle this problem (ex. \cite{becker2011advanced},\cite{eck1996automatic} ), we conducted a profound prototyping work. In order to avoid a cumbersome and time-consuming implementation during the prototyping phase, we used MATLAB \cite{MATLAB}. Once the algorithms to be used are finalized, we implement the prototypes using a non-proprietary language, such as Python or C++.
