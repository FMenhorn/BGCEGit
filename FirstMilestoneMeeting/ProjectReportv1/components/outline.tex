\section*{Purpose of the document}
The purpose of this document is to describe the \emph{CAD-integrated Topology Optimization} software tool along with the theoretical background it relies on.
%
%This document describes the overall process of \textit{Topology Optimization} with the following conversion of an obtained surface back to CAD. It includes the required theoretical background, a brief description of external libraries used within the project and the detailed information about algorithms developed for the implementation of the functionality not provided by open source libraries available.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Document overview}
The document is arranged in chapters, covering introductions to the field and the project, background theory, and parts of implementation. The chapters are described in more detail below.

\noindent {\scshape Chapter 2: Background theory}  \vspace{1mm}

\noindent This chapter introduces the theoretical background for the implementation of the \textit{CAD-integrated Topology Optimization} tool. It consists of four parts, each describing essential background of the topology optimization pipeline. Furthermore, detailed description of selected algorithms used in each step is given.
\\

\noindent {\scshape Chapter 3: Implementation}  \vspace{1mm}

\noindent This chapter provides details on the implementation and structure of the \textit{CAD-integrated Topology Optimization} tool itself. The different parts of the topology optimization pipeline are presented along with underlying implementation details.
