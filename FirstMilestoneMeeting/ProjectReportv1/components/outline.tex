\section*{Purpose of the document}
This document describes the overall process of \textit{Topology Optimization} with the following conversion of an obtained surface back to CAD. It includes the required theoretical background, a brief description of external libraries used within the project and the detailed information about algorithms developed for the implementation of the functionality not provided by open source libraries available.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Document overview}
The document is arranged in chapters. The current and first chapter provides a an overview of the document structure, brief introduction to the topic, motivation and administrative details of the project. The second chapter provides a thorough review of the theory and techniques used within the project.
