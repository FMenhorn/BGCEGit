\subsection{Peters' Scheme for $C^1$ Bezier surface reconstruction}
Although the process of generating a NURBS surface may trivially only seem to consist of placing out the control points near the desired surface location, getting it to assume a specified shape can be quite a task. As generating a more complex topology than a torus \todointern{possible reference to figure above} also requires several NURBS surfaces joined together, one needs to filfill certain requirements in order for it to remain connected. For simple surface continuity ($C^0$), it is enough that the control points and knots on the edges of the two patches are the same (if they are of the maximum multiplicity), the surface then on both edges follows a 1D--NURBS-curve from these points and knots. As higher-order continuity desired for smooth surfaces creates much more complex requirements, several schemes have been created to automate such tasks.

One such scheme is the scheme of Peters, described in \cite{peters1992constructing}, which starts from an unstructured mesh of polygonal faces, and creates from the location and connectivity of its vertices a surface that is \emph{tangent plane continous}, or $G^1$. This means that the normal vector to the plane is countinous, resulting in a smooth surface without sharp corners. The process consists of two steps, as described below.

\todointern[inline]{insert stuff here}
In this section we will cover the following, referring to \cite{peters1992constructing}:
\begin{itemize}
\item How we go from polygonal faces to a set of mesh control points. "patch points", specifying that we're talking about quads, and that we then get 16
\item That for each of these 16 points, we will make a small Bezier patch
\item That if we define the Bezier control points of these patches in a special way, as described in appendix XYZ \todointern{TODO: create this appendix, or change this to refer to paper for coefficients}, we get a surface that is $G^1$ continous
\item Maybe describe that we then need for every one of these Bezier patches the locations of the neighbours
\item That the location of a point on the surface defined by parameters $\vec{s} = (u,v)$ depends on the Bezier control points, whose linear dependence on the "patch points" give us coefficients on these "patch points" of the location described by the parameters, as can be seen in \autoref{fig:PetersPoints}
\item Possibly that this can used to fit the location of these "patch points" to a set of datapoints by minimusing a least-squares error \todointern{stress the relation to parametrized datapoints}
\end{itemize}
