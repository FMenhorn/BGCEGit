\section{Voxel data surface reconstruction}
\label{sec:surfaceBackg}
In order to fit \ac{NURBS} and other curves to an optimized geometry, a \emph{mesh-based geometry}, that is, a representation of the object at a set of (connected) points, is typically needed, this as opposed to the volumetric representation of density in each voxel, that results from the topology optimization process. 

In order to produce the mesh-based geometry, the data can be represented by a contour at a value of a smooth function in space, that is, an isosurface. Below, we describe four methods that solve this problem, the \acl{MC}, the \acl{DC}, the \acl{DualMC} and the \acl{DualMT} method. This section is only intended for giving a brief overview over the different methods and the most important properties regarding our application. For more details we refer to \cite{Marching2006, Hermite2002, Nielson2004, Nielson2008}. \todo{this remark is useful?} One should also note that surface reconstruction from voxel data --- what we are doing --- and surface reconstruction from range scan data (for examples see \todo{give example}) are similar, but still different tasks.
