\section{From Voxels to a surface representation}
\label{sec:surfaceBackg}
In order to fit NURBS and other curves to an optimized geometry, a \emph{mesh--based geometry}, that is, a representation of the object at a set of (connected) points, is typically needed, this as opposed to the volumetric representation of density in each voxel, that results from the topology optimization process. 

In order to produce the mesh--based geometry, the data can be represented by a contour at a value of a smooth function in space, that is, an isosurface. Below, we describe three methods that solve this problem, the \emph{Marching Cubes}, the \emph{Dual Contouring} and the \emph{Dual marching cubes} method. For detailed description of the methods we refer to \todo[inline]{insert references to main papers of MC, DC, dualMC}.
