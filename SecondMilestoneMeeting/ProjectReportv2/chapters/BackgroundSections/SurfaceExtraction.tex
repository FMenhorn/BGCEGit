\section{Voxel data surface reconstruction}
\label{sec:surfaceBackg}
\todo[inline]{Benni: Don't overuse acronyms}
A \emph{mesh-based geometry}, which is a representation of the object at a set of (connected) points, is typically needed to fit \ac{NURBS} and other curves to an optimized geometry. A voxel surface reconstruction is the necessary aproach since the topology optimization process results in a volumetric representation of density in each voxel. 

In order to produce the mesh-based geometry, the data can be represented by a contour at a value of a smooth function in space, that is, an isosurface. Below, we describe four methods that solve this problem, the \acl{MC}, the \acl{DC}, the \acl{DualMC} and the \acl{DualMT} method. This section is only intended for giving a brief overview over the different methods and the most important properties regarding our application. For more details we refer to \cite{Marching2006, Hermite2002, Nielson2004, Nielson2008}. 

\todo[inline]{Benni: this remark is useful. But explain in more detail. Change sentence, explain what in particular voxel surface reconstruction is. Leave out range surface reconstruction.} One should also note that surface reconstruction from voxel data --- what we are doing --- and surface reconstruction from range scan data (for example see \todo{give example}) are similar, but still different tasks.
