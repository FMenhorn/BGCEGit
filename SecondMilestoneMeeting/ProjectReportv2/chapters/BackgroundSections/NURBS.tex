\section{Fitting \acs{NURBS} to data}
\label{sec:NURBS}

\todo[inline]{expand this! and a better name}
In this section we will discuss:
\begin{itemize}
\item Parametrized curves and surfaces such as Bezier and NURBS surfaces
\item Peter's scheme, a scheme for generating tangent plane continous ($G^1$) surfaces from an unstructured mesh of polygonal faces as first described in...[ref]
\item Possibly how to fit this surface to parametrized datapoints using least squares. That could be impl.
\end{itemize}
