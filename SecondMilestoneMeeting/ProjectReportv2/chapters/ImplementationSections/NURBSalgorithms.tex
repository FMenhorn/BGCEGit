\section{From Parametrized Surface Points to NURBS representation}
As of yet, there is no open-source software which provides the conversion from a \textit{mesh-based} geometry to NURBS representation. Hence, one of the main challenges of both the algorithmic and implementation part of this project is to develop one from scratch. Due to a variety of possible approaches to tackle this problem (e.g. \cite{ eck1996automatic, becker2011advanced}), we have conducted a profound prototyping work. In order to avoid a cumbersome and time-consuming implementation overheads during the prototyping phase, we have used MATLAB \cite{MATLAB}. Once the algorithms to be used are finalized, the prototypes are to be implemented using a non-proprietary language, such as Python or C++.\todointern{this will be edited, of course.}
