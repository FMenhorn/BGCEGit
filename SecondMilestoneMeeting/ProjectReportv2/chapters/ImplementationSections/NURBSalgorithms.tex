\section{From extracted surface to NURBS representation: an algorithmic journey}
As of yet, there is no open-source software which provides the conversion from a \textit{mesh-based} geometry to NURBS representation. Hence, one of the main challenges of both the algorithmic and implementation part of this project is to develop one from scratch. Due to a variety of possible approaches to tackle this problem (e.g. \cite{becker2011advanced},\cite{eck1996automatic}), we have conducted a profound prototyping work. In order to avoid a cumbersome and time-consuming implementation overheads during the prototyping phase, we have used MATLAB \cite{MATLAB}. Once the algorithms to be used are finalized, the prototypes are to be implemented using a non-proprietary language, such as Python or C++.
