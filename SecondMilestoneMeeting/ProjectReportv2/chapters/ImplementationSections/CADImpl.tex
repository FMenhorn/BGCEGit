\section{From \acs{CAD} to Voxels}

\label{sec: CADToVoxels}
One of the hurdles with most state-of-the-art open source topology optimization tools is their input format, where many of them (including ToPy, our topology optimizer of choice) require input to be specified as a 3-dimensional voxel grid. Presence (or absence) of material in these voxels is defined by a boolean variable, and boundary conditions are imposed on the appropriate locations. An example of voxelized data can be seen in \autoref{fig: voxelOpenCascade}. %Since there is a variety of toolboxes available which are able to perform a voxelization of common CAD input files, we did not implement one of our own but rather adapted one of the open source tools. %This section describes how we overcame this hurdle of converting CAD representations to voxelized input.

In terms of implementation, the only thing required is the installation of the CVMLCPP library. The voxelizer is then included as a callable binary, that takes STL-file input (\autoref{subsub:STL}) and converts it to a .dat binary file with dimension and voxel information, with specifiable voxel size. An example result of using the voxelizer is shown in \autoref{fig: voxelizerStar}.
 %In the end, to voxelize a file given as .stl-input, we could just call 
%\begin{lstlisting}
%~/Path/To/CVMLCPP/bin/voxelize ./<stl_file>.stl <voxelSize>
%\end{lstlisting}
%where $\mathtt{<voxelSize>}$ is an integer declaring the size of a voxel.
