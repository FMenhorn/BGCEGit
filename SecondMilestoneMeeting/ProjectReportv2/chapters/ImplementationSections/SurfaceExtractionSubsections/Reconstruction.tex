\subsection{Surface reconstruction}
In \autoref{sec:surfaceBackg} different surface reconstruction schemes have been introduced. In the following we want to discuss our choice for an appropriate surface reconstruction scheme and explain necessary modifications to it.

\subsubsection{Discussion on surface reconstruction schemes}
Since the surface reconstruction is just an intermediate step before our final \ac{NURBS} fitting procedure, only producing a good approximation of the surface of our topology is not sufficient, but some further constraints have to be kept in mind:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \ac{NURBS} have a rectangular topology, therefore our surface reconstruction should also be able to provide a surface consisting of rectangular patches.
\item Peters scheme only covers manifold surfaces, meaning that per edge each patch is only allowed to have exactly one neighbour.
\end{enumerate}
The first requirement is met by \ac{DC}, while the second one is only met by \ac{MC}. We decided to use the \ac{DC} method, because already the basic version of it creates \acp{quad}, while \ac{MC} creates a mesh of triangles, which can only be changed into a mesh of \acp{quad} by considerably increasing the number of faces.

\begin{comment}

\subsubsection{Discussion \ac{MC}}
\todo[inline]{discussion makes more sense after the NURBS part.}
\todo[inline]{needs to be formulated}
Pro:
\begin{itemize}
\item produces proper \todo{what does proper mean?} surfaces
\item very simple
\end{itemize}
Contra:
\begin{itemize}
\item triangles
\item no feature detection (explicit detection with extended MC)
\item very many faces (at least in basic implementation)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Discussion \ac{DC}}
\todo[inline]{discussion makes more sense after the NURBS part.}
\todo[inline]{poorly written...}
\ac{DC} generates \acp{quad} instead of \acp{tri} and therefore fits better to the rectangular topology of \ac{NURBS}. The possibility of making \ac{DC} an adaptive algorithm is another advantage.
Since we do not rely on first order Hermite data and the minimization of the \ac{QEF} but just on a very simple averaging procedure, we loose one of the main advantages of \ac{DC}, namely the ability to represent sharp features. But we do not care about sharp features in the context of topology optimization. 
The main disadvantage of \ac{DC} is that it is not always generating manifold surfaces. Our approach of solving this issue by remeshing is more a hack than a real solution to the problem.
\end{comment}

\subsubsection{Our implementation of \ac{DC}}
We used the open-source language PYTHON \cite{Python} for the implementation of \ac{DC}. Compared to the version described in \cite{Hermite2002} we applied some modifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item We do not care about sharp features and cannot easily access gradient information in our algorithm. Therefore we did not use \autoref{eq:QEF} for the generation of new vertices, but the simple averaging scheme decribed in \autoref{ssec:DC}.
\item We want to locate our surface at the interface of material and no-material and not at a certain isovalue, because our dataset only consists of boolean values instead of real valued quantities.
\item We did not implement the adaptive and topology safe scheme but a scheme for uniform grids which does not support adaptive mesh simplification or topology checks.
\end{itemize}
This leads to the following modified \ac{DC} scheme:
\begin{enumerate}
\item On each cube edge find the root (i.e. the interface of material and no-material voxels) using bisection. We assume our surface to exactly lie in the middle between material and no-material voxels, if no further information is available.
\item Take the mean value of all root positions for determining the position of the newly introduced vertex.
\item Join the vertices associated with four cubes sharing a common edge, to form a \ac{quad}.
\end{enumerate}
So far our procedure generates \ac{quad} surfaces for boolean datasets on uniform Cartesian grids. But like for the original \ac{DC} algorithm we cannot guarantee that those surfaces are manifold.

\subsubsection{Obtaining manifold surfaces}
Since we want to deduce a first estimate for the topology of the \ac{NURBS} surface output of our \ac{CADTopOpt} tool, non-manifold surfaces cannot be accepted\footnote{Surfaces consisting of smoothly connected \ac{NURBS} \acp{patch} are always manifold surfaces. Therefore we cannot start with a non-manifold surface and assume we will end up with a manifold surface.}. We implemented a remeshing procedure for generating manifold surfaces out of non-manifold surfaces.

Our procedure has the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find all non-manifold edges, which are connected to more than two \acp{quad}.
\item All non-manifold edges are split into two manifold edges with only two \acp{quad} connected to them.
\item The members of each pair of manifold edges are moved into opposite directions. 
\end{enumerate}
The directions, in which we are moving the resulting manifold edges, can be determined by estimating the gradient at the position of the former non-manifold edge. Please note that we can only estimate the gradient, if additional information in the middle of the faces penetrated by non-manifold edges is available. Otherwise it is not possible to resolve the ambiguity, causing generation of the non-manifold edge, in a proper way and therefore we cannot eliminate the non-manifold edge.

We illustrate the procedure for a 2D example in \autoref{fig:manifoldResolution2D}. Please note that for the 3D case additional patterns occur and not only the \acp{quad} which are connected to the whole non-manifold edge have to be considered, but also the \acp{quad} connected to only one vertex of the edge. This implies also the introduction of new \acp{quad} at other locations (\autoref{fig:manifoldPatterns3D}).

\subsubsection{Topology--safe adaptivity \ac{DC}}
\todo[inline]{Benni: this is a outlook, remove, put into comment.}
Implementing this feature in \ac{DC} will be one of our major goals in the future. Whether adding adaptivity to the basic \ac{DC} algorithm will destroy the property of \ac{DC} only generating \acp{quad} by introducing \acp{tri}, is going to be part of our future research.
