\subsection{Applying Peters' Scheme}
In this section we will describe:
\begin{itemize}
\item That we apply the theory in section \autoref{sec:NURBS} about Peters' Scheme to fit datapoints from Dual Contouring in \autoref{sec:DC}\todo{fix this ref} and the coarse quads and the parameters on them to obtain a $G^1$ surface
\item That we implemented this as Python classes and structures after MATLAB prototyping, \autoref{fig:fittingStructures} for reference
\item How they work algorithmically, \textit{(whenever they work)}
\item What libraries we used to do the least-squares an plotting an stuff
\end{itemize}
