\subsection{Topology Optimization tool ToPy}
ToPy \cite{ToPy} is a python library/program, written by William Hunter and documented in \cite{Hunter2009}, implementing the SIMP model and method described in \autoref{subsec:TopOpTheory}. It is based on the 99-line Matlab code by Sigmund's for minimum compliance \cite{sigmund200199}. The program can optimize the previously named problem types: minimum compliance, heat conduction and mechanism synthesis --- in 2D as well as 3D. It uses highly optimized open source python libraries such as Pysparse \cite{Pysparse} and Numpy \cite{Numpy}, leading to improved speed, porta- and scalability. %The whole program is steered by an input file which-- with the help of the documentation-- is straightforward to use and easy to adapt. %citation on pysparse and numpy


%In terms of our implementation, 
We use ToPy as a black-box topology optimizer. This means, we launch the program with an input file based on our scenario and let ToPy run. Next, as soon as the output is available, we proceed with the next step. The intention is to create separate modules to be able to plug in different solvers later on. In order to specify our input, we wrote an auxiliary program taking a voxelized CAD design provided by OpenCascade as input, outputting a .tpd file with geometry, load and fixture information in the format required by ToPy.
