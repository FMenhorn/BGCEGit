@article{Nielson2004,
abstract = { We present the definition and computational algorithms for a new class of surfaces which are dual to the isosurface produced by the widely used marching cubes (MC) algorithm. These new isosurfaces have the same separating properties as the MC surfaces but they are comprised of quad patches that tend to eliminate the common negative aspect of poorly shaped triangles of the MC isosurfaces. Based upon the concept of this new dual operator, we describe a simple, but rather effective iterative scheme for producing smooth separating surfaces for binary, enumerated volumes which are often produced by segmentation algorithms. Both the dual surface algorithm and the iterative smoothing scheme are easily implemented.},

@article{Nielson2008,
abstract = {We discuss the dual marching tetrahedra (DMT) method. The DMT can be viewed as a generalization of the classical cuberille method of Chen et al. to a tetrahedronal. The cuberille method produces a rendering of quadrilaterals comprising a surface that separates voxels deemed to be contained in an object of interest from those voxels not in the object. A cuberille is a region of 3D space partitioned into cubes. A tetrahedronal is a region of 3D space decomposed into tetrahedra. The DMT method generalizes the cubille method from cubes to tetrahedra and corrects a fundamental problem of the original cuberille method where separating surfaces are not necessarily manifolds. For binary segmented data, we propose a method for computing the location of vertices this is based upon the use of a minimal discrete norm curvature criterion. For applications where dependent function values are given at grid points, two alternative methods for computing vertex positions are discussed and compared. Examples are drawn from a variety of applications, including the Yes/No/Don’t{\_}Know data sets resulting from inconclusive segmentation processes and Well-Log data sets.},

We present an extension of DC that further guarantees that the mesh generated is a manifold even under adaptive simplification. Our main contribution is an octree-based topology-preserving vertex-clustering algorithm for adaptive contouring. The contoured surface generated by our method contains only manifold vertices and edges, preserves sharp features, and possesses much better adaptivity than those generated by other isosurfacing methods under topologically safe simplification.},
