\begin{frame}{Long way to smoothness}
\begin{block}{Peters' scheme:}
Given the control mesh $M_{x}$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Refine the \textit{control mesh} 2 times using Doo-Sabin refinement
\item Construct a tensor product Bezier patches (biquadratic or bicubic) centred on the each vertex of the refined \textit{control mesh}
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}
\textbf{{\color{red} According to Peters obtained surface is $G^{1}$ smooth}}

Add pictures for Doo-Sabin and for fitting
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Long way to smoothness}
\begin{block}{Main ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the mesh obtained from Dual Contouring as a \textit{control mesh}
\item Modify the fitting step to take advantage of the \textbf{Peters' scheme}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
$$\downarrow$$
\begin{equation}
E_{dist}(V_{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\norm{p_{i} - y_{i}V_{x}}^{2} \rightarrow min,
\end{equation}
$y_{i}$ - coefficients obtained from the Peters' scheme theory.
\begin{block}{What is achieved?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Smoothness of the fitted surface is now guaranteed by construction
\item Fitting is possible for more complex shapes achieved by using an information from the Dual Contouring algorithm
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Improved pipeline}
Insert a nice new pipeline in tikz: orig points $->$ dual contouring $->$ clouds $->$ Doo-Sabin $->$ fitted surface together with clouds
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Before and after}
May be some pictures with a really easy shape, which we were able to fit last time and it was not smooth and the ones with new fancy smooth shapes
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{What is next?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finishing of the implementation of the improved pipeline in Python
\item Full integration with Surface Extraction part
\item Introducing of the \textit{fairness functional} in order to deal with more complex shapes
\item Implementation of the \textit{adaptive refinement} in order to control a maximum error tolerance
\item Implementation of the \textit{parameter correction} for the improved pipeline
\item Exporting the results back to CAD  
\end{itemize}
