\begin{frame}{What problems did we have to solve?}

Computational, scientific, but also:

\begin{itemize}
\item What algorithms did we have to implement?
\item What tools can we use to implement them?
\item What had already been done? \\
(Can we use it? How?)
\item Who does what? Who can do what?
\item When?
\end{itemize}
