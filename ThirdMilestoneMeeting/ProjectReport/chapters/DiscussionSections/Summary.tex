In summary, a full tool-chain from CAD input file to an optimized CAD file is provided. First, a voxelization is performed using OpenCASCADE in order to bring the initial geometry to an appropriate case description. Secondly, the topology is optimized by employing the open-source tool ToPy \cite{ToPy}.  
Next, a two-stage Dual Contouring surface reconstruction scheme for coarse parametrization patches and fine vertices is computed.
A B-Spline surface is fitted by a least-square approach using control points described by the Peters' scheme in order to ensure geometrically continuous surfaces. Lastly, a FreeCAD macro script performs boolean operations to enforce geometric constraints and exports the geometry to a standardized CAD file \cite{FreeCAD}.
Note that intermediate steps can be replaced in the future with a more suitable solution. 

In conclusion, the implementation provides a user-friendly CAD-integrated topology optimization tool. The functionality of the tool is tested by three test cases explained in chapter \ref{sec:tests}.
