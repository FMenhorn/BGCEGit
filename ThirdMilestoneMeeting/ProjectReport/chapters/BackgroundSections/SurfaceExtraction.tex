\section{Voxel Data Surface Reconstruction}
\label{sec:surfaceBackg}
A \emph{mesh-based geometry}, which is a representation of the object at a set of (connected) points, is typically needed to fit \ac{NURBS} and other curves to an optimized geometry. Conversion to a voxel-based surface reconstruction is necessary, since the topology optimization process results in a volumetric representation of density in each voxel.

In order to produce the mesh-based geometry, the data can be represented by a contour at a value of a smooth function in space, that is, an isosurface. Below, we describe two methods that solve this problem, \acl{MC} and \acl{DC}. This section is only intended for giving a brief overview of the different methods and the most important properties concerning our application. For more details we refer to \cite{Marching2006, Hermite2002}. 

One should also note that surface reconstruction from voxel data is a special case of surface reconstruction and should not be mixed up with other surface reconstruction classes (like for example surface reconstruction from surface points in \cite{eck1996automatic}). Voxel surface reconstruction works on datasets on Cartesian grids with either boolean inside-outside information or floating point values representing a certain quantity -- e.g. density -- on each gridpoint. The aim of voxel data surface reconstruction is to find the surface dividing the inside from the outside region (for boolean datasets) or denoting a certain isovalue (for floating point datasets). One example application for voxel data surface reconstruction is the process of generating isosurfaces from computer tomography data, which makes structures likes bones visible.
