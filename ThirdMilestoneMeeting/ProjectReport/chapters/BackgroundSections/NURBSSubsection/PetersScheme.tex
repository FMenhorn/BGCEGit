\subsection{Peters' Scheme for $G^1$ B{\'e}zier Surface Reconstruction}
\label{subsec:peters}
Although the process of generating a NURBS surface may seem trivial (placing the control points near the desired surface location), getting it to assume a specified shape can be quite a task. Generating a topology more complex than a torus \todointern{possible reference to figure above} requires several NURBS surfaces joined together. Thus, one needs to fulfil certain requirements in order for these surfaces to remain connected. For simple surface continuity ($C^0$), it is enough that the control points and knots on the edges of the two patches are the same, since then on both edges the surface follows a 1D--NURBS-curve from these points and knots. Smooth surfaces require higher-order continuity, which creates much more complex requirements. Several schemes have been created to automate such tasks.

The approach sometimes referred to as \emph{surface splines} or \emph{G-splines} \cite{eck1996automatic} solves the task of generating a smooth surface by starting from a \emph{control mesh} $\petersControlMesh$ of points, and computes B{\'e}zier surfaces by setting their control points to be linear combinations of the points in $\petersControlMesh$. The coefficients are determined such that the resulting surfaces will be \emph{tangent plane continous}, or $G^1$, or other desired degrees of smoothness.

One such scheme is the scheme of Peters, described in \cite{peters1992constructing}, which starts from an unstructured mesh of polygonal faces, and creates a $G^1$--continous surface from the location and connectivity of its vertices. This means that the normal vector to the plane is countinous, resulting in a smooth surface without sharp corners. The process consists of two steps, described below for a mesh of quadrilateral faces (quads) \cite{eck1996automatic}. However, the scheme could also be applied for a mesh with any mixture of polygons.

\subsubsection{Step 1: Mesh Refinement}
In the first step, the mesh is refined through two iterations of \emph{Doo-Sabin refinement}, as first described in \cite{DooSabin1978subdiv}. This refinement is done by creating new points $\vec{m}_{ref}$ around the vertices $\petersControlMeshVec$ in the control mesh $\petersControlMesh$. One such point is created for every face $f_{\vec{m}}$ that $\petersControlMeshVec$ corners, the new point $\vec{m}_{ref}$ being placed between $\petersControlMeshVec$ and the centroid $\centroidof{f_{\petersControlMeshVec}}$ of the bordering face $f_{\petersControlMeshVec}$ (the centroid of a face being the position of the face's vertices). After having done this for all the points in the control mesh $\petersControlMesh$, we group all the points $\vec{m}_{ref}$ into a new refined mesh $\petersControlMeshRef$. Describing this mathematically for the faces $\petersFaces$, with face ${\hat{f}}\in \petersFaces$ having vertices $V_{\hat{f}}$:

\begin{align}
\petersControlMeshRef =& \left\lbrace \petersControlMeshVec_{ref} \suchthat\petersControlMeshVec_{ref} = \alpha\petersControlMeshVec + (1-\alpha)\centroidof{f} \suchthat f \in \facesof{\petersControlMeshVec} \suchthat \right.
\\ \notag &
 \left. \suchthat \petersControlMeshVec \in \petersControlMesh, \alpha \in (0,1) \right\rbrace
\\
\where \qquad\qquad \centroidof{\hat{f}} =& \; \text{average}\left(\petersControlMeshVec_{\hat{f}}\right)_{\petersControlMeshVec_{\hat{f}} \in \verticesof{\hat{f}}}
\\
\text{and} \qquad\qquad F_{\vec{\hat{m}}} =& \left\lbrace \hat{f} \in \petersFaces \suchthat \vec{\hat{m}} \in \verticesof{\hat{f}}	\right\rbrace
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is a smoothening parameter, controlling the sharpness of the corners and edges, which we for simplicity set to $1/2$, to get a simple midpoint.

Thus, in every refinement step on an $n$--gon, $n$ vertices are created, giving 4 vertices for a quad in the original control mesh. These are then joined up with the neighbours on the quad to form a smaller quad, and with the neighbouring points from the same vertex on the neighbouring quads, forming a quad along each edge. Around a quad corner, where $n$ quads meet (or $n$ edges in the general case), we instead get an $n$--gon around the corner vertex. After two refinements, we thus get a mesh of vertices $\petersPatchPoints$ that mainly consists of quads, with possibilities of getting polygons with other number of edges around the vertices of the original mesh $\petersControlMesh$. The mesh and the resulting structure after two subdivisions can be seen in \autoref{fig:petersSubDivide}b.\todourgent[inline,author=Benni]{illustrate this with a figure with the notation that is introduced here: what is $V_x$?}\todointernal{maybe fancy peter's scheme picture, alt the one in EckHoppe for what the thingymajong looks like after 2x ref.}

\subsubsection{Step 2: \Bez Patch Creation}
In this step, we create one \Bez patch for every vertex in the double refined mesh $\petersControlMeshDobRef$. 

To begin with, we can recognize that each original quad now has a $4 \times 4$ grid of vertices, where the $4$ vertices along each original quad edge match the $4$ vertices on the neighbouring quad (see \autoref{fig:petersSubDivide}b). From this, we see that most of the cells will be locally in a regular grid, in the sense that it can be seen as the center grid point in a $3\times3$ \todointernal[author=Benni]{which $3\times3$ grid? I thought its $4\times4$...Is it the red grid in Fig. 2.4.3 a)?}two-dimensional structured grid.% have $8$ local neighbours ($4$ along the edges of the double refined quads, and $4$ along the diagonals of the doubly refined quads). 

Taking one such point $\petersLocalPatchPointIndices{0,0}$, and its neighbours $\petersLocalPatchPointIndices{i,j}$, where $i,j \in \left \lbrace-1,0,1\right \rbrace$, we can now interpret them as the control points for a biquadratic (that is, second-order) tensor product B-spline surface (meaning with uniform knots). This we can then extend to include all the points that are also locally in a regular grid (and their neighbours in their own local $3\times3$ grid). This results in a $C^1$ continous surface around all vertices where the mesh is locally regular.
%For those cells, we can now create biquadratic tensor splines that meet $G^1$ along the edges and corners; that is, the tensor product of one quadratic spline in one of the regular mesh directions and one in the other.
Now, this surface can also be represented by a network of a biquadratic tensor product \Bez surface patches (see \autoref{fig:petersSubDivide}c for the patch structure). This means, around a vertex $\petersLocalPatchPointIndices{0,0}$, we create \Bez surface, with $3\times3$ control points for each patch, that we choose to call $\petersLocalBezPointIndices{i,j}$ ($i,j \in \left \lbrace{-1},0,1\right \rbrace$). If we do this, the $3\times3$ \Bez control points $\petersLocalBezPointIndices{i,j}$ will lie at positions in-between the center vertex $\petersLocalPatchPointIndices{0,0}$ and the $3\times3$ local grid vertices $\petersLocalPatchPointIndices{i,j}$, as shown in \cite{peters1992constructing}:
\begin{equation}
\petersLocalBezPointIndices{i,j} = \frac{1}{4}\left(\petersLocalPatchPointIndices{i,j} + \petersLocalPatchPointIndices{i,0} + \petersLocalPatchPointIndices{0,j} + \petersLocalPatchPointIndices{0,0}\right)
\end{equation}
or, writing it out explicitly for $i,j \in \left \lbrace{-1},0,1\right \rbrace$,

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{align*}
\petersLocalBezPointIndices{{-1},1\phantom{-}} =&\, \frac{1}{4}\left(\petersLocalPatchPointIndices{{-1},1} + \petersLocalPatchPointIndices{{-1},0} + \petersLocalPatchPointIndices{0,1} + \petersLocalPatchPointIndices{0,0}\right)

The exceptions that cannot be placed in a regular mesh are now the points residing on the corners of the original quads. 
Here, any number of quads may be meeting.
%This comes from the fact that at quad corners, we may have any number of quads meeting, starting from 3. 
\tododone{possible example fig?} For $n$ quads sharing a corner vertex, the refinement steps will create a polygon with $n$ sides, as mentioned above. If $n\neq4$, the vertices of these corner polygons cannot be placed in a locally regular mesh, and we cannot apply the previous technique -- see for example the upper-left corner of \autoref{fig:petersSubDivide}b.

However, we can still create a \Bez patch which connects smoothly to the locally regular points. To do this, we create a bicubic \Bez patch (of polynomial order 3 one higher than around the regular points, meaning it has $4\times4$ control points) for every vertex in the corner polygon.
We then evaluate how the surface position and normal direction depends on the \Bez control points along all edges of the patches. In order to have a smooth connection, we want these to match, and thus, we can produce constraints for the positions of the \Bez control points.
Since the surfaces are defined at each point as linear combinations of the \Bez control points (which in turn are linear combinations of the vertices in the doubly refined mesh $\petersControlMeshDobRef$), the constraints result in an underdetermined system of linear equations for all the \Bez control points on the bicubic \Bez patches on the vertices in the doubly refined mesh $\petersControlMeshDobRef$.

As the resulting formulae for the locations of the \Bez control points are rather lengthy and complex, we refer to the original paper (ref. \cite{peters1992constructing}) for a solution which produces nice-looking, smoothly connected surfaces. Here, it is also proven that the surfaces have an overall $G^1$ connectivity. A cut-out sample can be seen in \autoref{subfig:smoothsurf}.
\todourgent[inline]{insert points in appendix}

To summarize, Peters' scheme is a mathematical algorithm for creating biquadratic and bicubic \Bez patches that join with $G^1$ continuity, from a mesh of polygons. Firstly, a set of refined mesh points is created on each polygon. Then, \Bez control points defining the patches are created as linear combinations of the vertices in this refined mesh. The $G^1$ continuity results from the interpretation of the refined mesh as a regular biquadratic tensor product B-spline surface, and where this is not possible, bicubic \Bez patches are constrained to join smoothly to the surrounding biquadratic patches.
%In this section we will cover the following, referring to \cite{peters1992constructing}:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item How we go from polygonal faces to a set of mesh control points. "patch points", specifying that we're talking about quads, and that we then get 16
%\item That for each of these 16 points, we will make a small B{\'e}zier patch
%\item That if we define the B{\'e}zier control points of these patches in a special way, as described in appendix XYZ \todointern{TODO: create this appendix, or change this to refer to paper for coefficients}, we get a surface that is $G^1$ continous
%\item Maybe describe that we then need for every one of these B{\'e}zier patches the locations of the neighbours
%\item That the location of a point on the surface defined by parameters $\vec{s} = (u,v)$ depends on the B{\'e}zier control points, whose linear dependence on the "patch points" give us coefficients on these "patch points" of the location described by the parameters, as can be seen in \autoref{fig:PetersPoints}
