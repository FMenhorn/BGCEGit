\section{From Voxel Representation to Parametrized Surface Points}
\label{sec:surfaceImpl}
Surface extraction is an intermediate step between topology optimization and \ac{NURBS} representation. This intermediate step is crucial, because it generates the data for \ac{NURBS} surface fitting and for the underlying topology of the \ac{NURBS} patches. Broadly, the process consists of two steps: Surface reconstruction and parameterization of datapoints.
