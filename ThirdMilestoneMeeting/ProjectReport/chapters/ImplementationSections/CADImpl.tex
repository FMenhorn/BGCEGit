\section{From \acs{CAD} Model to Voxel Representation}
\label{sec: CADToVoxels}
Converting the CAD input to ToPy input along with all the boundary conditions is the first problem that needs to be addressed in our pipeline. The procedure has been described in four sections: the first section explains the logic behind specifying boundary conditions using a CAD software. Subsequent sections then talk about what the code does with this CAD input. The second section explains the extraction of different boundaries from the CAD geometry with extensive use of the OpenCascade C++ library. This is followed by two more sections on voxelization and writing of the output file. Finally, the last section explains the input file format for ToPy, and describes its operation. \autoref{fig:umlCADToVoxel} shows an overview of the structure of the code used for this part of the pipeline.

 %In the end, to voxelize a file given as .stl-input, we could just call 
%\begin{lstlisting}
%~/Path/To/CVMLCPP/bin/voxelize ./<stl_file>.stl <voxelSize>
%\end{lstlisting}
%where $\mathtt{<voxelSize>}$ is an integer declaring the size of a voxel.
