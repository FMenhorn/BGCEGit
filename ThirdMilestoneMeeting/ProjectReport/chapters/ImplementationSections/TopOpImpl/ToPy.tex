\subsection{Topology Optimization Tool ToPy}
ToPy \cite{ToPy} is a python library/program, written by William Hunter and documented in \cite{Hunter2009}, implementing the SIMP model and method (\autoref{subsec:TopOpTheory}). It is based on the 99-line Matlab code by Sigmund's for minimum compliance \cite{sigmund200199}. The program can optimize for minimum compliance, heat conduction and mechanism synthesis --- in two- and three-dimensions. It uses highly optimized open source python libraries such as Pysparse \cite{Pysparse} and Numpy \cite{Numpy}, leading to improved speed, portability and scalability. %The whole program is steered by an input file which-- with the help of the documentation-- is straightforward to use and easy to adapt. %citation on pysparse and numpy


%In terms of our implementation, 
We use ToPy as a black-box topology optimizer. This means, we launch the program with an input file based on our scenario and let ToPy run. The output of ToPy is then plugged in to the next module. The intention is to create separate modules to be able to easily switch them later on if need be.
