\section{Topology Optimization of Voxel Data}
\label{sec:ToPy}
After having created a 3D voxel raster of the shape, the next step is to perform a topology optimization, as described in section \ref{sec:TopOpt}. 
Gaive the wide range of topology optimization software available, we decided to adapt an open-source topology optimizer to our needs, namely \emph{ToPy}.
