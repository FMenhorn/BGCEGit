\section{From NURBS to Standardized CAD File Format}
In order to create standardized CAD files from previously computed B-Spline control points, the scripting functionality offered by FreeCAD is employed. Almost all functions of FreeCAD can be called using a python script, which allows utilization FreeCAD functions within our automated workflow. \cite{FreeCAD}

%installation path
The implemented python script is structured as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The installation path for FreeCAD is specified and its modules are imported separately
\item A new document is opened and B-Spline patches are created consecutively using the control points obtained from Peters' scheme
\item The object is reoriented to revert coordinate changes imposed by ToPy (see section \ref{sec: ToPyInputConstruction}) and exported as a basic output (without appplying geometry and domain constraints)
\item Geometry and domain constraints are enforced with boolean operations
\item The active object is exported as step file, which is the final output of the program
\end{enumerate}
