\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:Implementation}	
The previous chapter introduced the fundamental concepts and ideas used in this project. This chapter describes how these are actually put to use, with details of all four sections of the workflow pipeline: starting from a CAD geometry input, obtaining a voxelized input for the topology optimizer, extracting the surface from the optimized voxel grid, to fitting smooth, optimally sized curves through it.
