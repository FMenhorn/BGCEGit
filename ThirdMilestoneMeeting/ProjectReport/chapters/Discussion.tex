\chapter{Summary and Future Work}
\todourgent[inline]{What did we achieve? What are the weak spots of our algorithm?}
In the previous chapters, we have introduced the background theory, its implementation and the results of our CAD-integrated topology optimization tool CADO. Next, we give a short summary of what was accomplished in this work. Furthermore, we show possibilities for future work and improvements of this tool since it only can be seen as a prototype.\todo[inline]{Mention that it is a prototype?}
