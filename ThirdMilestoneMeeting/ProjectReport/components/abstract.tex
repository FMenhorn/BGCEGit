Topology optimization is becoming an increasingly important tool in computer aided design (CAD). Several topology optimization open-source tools exist already; however,  it can still be cumbersome to incorporate these tools efficiently in the design process. The main challenge lies in converting mesh-based topology optimized solutions to a smooth geometry representation. We address this issue with a two-stage Dual Contouring surface reconstruction scheme for coarse parametrization patches and fine vertices. A B-Spline surface is fitted by a least-square approach using control points described by the Peters' scheme. This ensures geometrically continuous surfaces. In conclusion, a fully CAD-integrated topology optimization tool-chain is provided.
