# Postproc DC
This folder contains postprocessing tools for our DC output.

## Postproc STEP 
Use STEP files for postprocessing (see back2CAD). Output two individual files per geometry:

- one file holds quads representing the coarse surface reconstruction (surface data)
- one file holds the fine vertices (only point data)
