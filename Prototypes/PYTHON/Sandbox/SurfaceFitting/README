There are two folders with the torus with different resolutions, both are to be tried to see which one gives best results.

Given are:
*List of coarse quads with respective vertices
*List of coarse vertices with x,y,z coordinates

*List of fine vertices with x,y,z coordinates
*List of parameters for each fine vertex: 
      #######   COARSE QUAD it belongs, U , V  #######


One torus should not have manifold problems
