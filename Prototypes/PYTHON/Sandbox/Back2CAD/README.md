#Back2CAD

This folder is for all development on the conversion of output data of Peters' scheme (mainly control points and patch distribution) to a standartd CAD format (```.step``` or ```.iges```).

##How to run
We are heavily relying on the **FreeCAD API**. Therefore you first have to install FreeCAD via ```apt-get install freecad```. Then you have to run our script directly from the FreeCAD python interpreter via ```/usr/bin/freecadcmd```.
