How to display iges/step with color using FreeCAD:

For Step file easy: Open step file and FreeCAD shows the face colors. For IGES this won't work. 

It's a bit tricky: Go to workbench part, then again in the upper menu press part --> Import CAD... and select Step/iges WITH colors.

For giving faces colors: In the tree left, right click on object and select Set colors.  Remember: for saving to IGS  part in the upper menu and Export CAD... Select IGS WITH colors. There is also IGES which is without colors.
