# Surface Extraction
Contains prototypes on Benni's & Juan Carlos' part of the work to do until 2.Milestone meeting.
## ToDos
- [ ] Implementation of Dual Contouring
- [ ] Implementation 2D Parametrization of sufrace datapoints on several line segments (no optimization!)
- [ ] Implementation 3D Parametrization of surface datapoints on several quad (or tri) patches (no optimization!)
- [ ] Test optimization: Quadtree in 2D (MATLAB or Python?)
- [ ] Is it possible to construct quadtree on the fly with dual contouring?
- [ ] Compare speed to speed without optimization.
